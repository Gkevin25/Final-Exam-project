                <p>Welcome to Tasty Treasure, where our signature crispy chicken and unique flavor combinations are served directly at your door. Located in the heart of ICT UNIVERSITY, we are passionate about delivering an unforgettable dining experience to every guest.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2024, Tasty Treasure started as a small food stall in the heart of the ICT UNIVERSITY. Our love for crispy chicken and unique flavors quickly gained a loyal following, leading us to open our first full-fledged restaurant. Over the years, we've stayed true to our roots while continuously innovating to meet the evolving tastes of our customers.</p>
